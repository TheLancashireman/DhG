# To do

There's lots to do.

* The graphical stuff is work-in-progress. "Work-in-suspended-animation" would be more accurate.
* The GEDCOM features are also wishful thinking.
* There are some hard-coded directories that need to be changed to use
  environment and/or the 'set' command
* Move the user's guide to the repository and make the version at thelancashireman.org
  into a wrapper.
