The program is unashamedly command-line driven. It doesn't give you a pretty interface to a hidden database. Instead, it helps you to create structured text files, one per person, then analyses the files to produce ancestor and descendant trees, immediate family reports and can even produce a static HTML web site.

The text file approach means that you always have full control of your data

# To do

There's lots to do.

* The graphical stuff is experimental work-in-progress. "Work-in-suspended-animation" would be more accurate.
* The GEDCOM features are also wishful thinking.
* There are some hard-coded directories that need to be changed to use
  environment and/or the 'set' command
* Move the user's guide to the repository and make the version at thelancashireman.org
  into a wrapper.
