    <h1>DhG</h1>
    <p>DhG is a suite of programs, libraries and other odds-and-ends that I use for maintaining
       a database of people as part of my family history research. I'm making it available to
       download free-of-charge on the off-chance that someone else might find it useful too.</p>
    <p>DhG is a command-line program that has been designed to work on unix-like operating
       systems such as GNU/Linux and FreeBSD. It might be possible to run it on a Mac (OS X)
       because that's BSD-based too. It might also be possible to run it on Windows; I haven't
       tried.</p>
    <p>DhG is written in perl and therefore needs a standard perl interpreter. It also depends
       on the <a href="http://template-toolkit.org/">Template toolkit</a>, which is available as
       an optional extra on some GNU/Linux distros. On Ubuntu the package is called "libtemplate-perl".</p>

    <h2>Download</h2>
    <p>You can get the latest version by cloning the repository on
      <a href="https://github.com/TheLancashireman/DhG">github</a> or by downloading a tarball.</p>

    <h2>Installation (by cloning)</h2>
    <p>Create an empty directory somewhere in your file system. Clone the git repository
      into the directory.</p>

    <h2>Installation (from tarball)</h2>
    <p>Create an empty directory somewhere in your file system. Download the DhG tarball from the link
       above and plonk it into the empty directory.</p>
    <p>Open an xterm or some other Terminal window, cd to the directory you created and unpack the
       DhG tarball. You can delete the tarball now:
      <pre>
        cd /whereever/you/put/DhG
        tar xzvf DhG.tar.gz
        rm DhG.tar.gz
      </pre></p>

    <h2>Setting up DhG</h2>
    <p>If the directory <tt>/usr/local/lib/site_perl</tt> already exists, go to the next step. Create
       the directory <tt>/usr/local/lib/site_perl</tt> --- you'll need root permissions, so:
      <pre>
        sudo mkdir /usr/local/lib/site_perl
      </pre></p>
    <p>Create symbolic links in /usr/local/lib/site_perl for all the perl-module files in the DhG
       suite:
      <pre>
        sudo ln -s `pwd`/*.pm /usr/local/lib/site_perl
      </pre>
       There are other places you can put the modules if you don't have root permissions or
       if you don't want to modify /usr/local/lib/site_perl. One way is to put the path to the
       modules into the environment variable PERL5LIB.</p>
    <p>Edit the file DhG. It's a shell script, and you need to configure the directories:<br/>
        /path/to is the directory where you unpacked the DhG tarball.<br/>
        ===WORKING-DIRECTORY=== is a working directory. This is where DhG puts all the generated output.<br/>
        ===DATABASE-DIRECTORY=== is the database directory. DhG scans this directory and all its subditrectories
        for files with the <tt>.card</tt> suffix.<br/>
       As an example, here's my script:
      <pre>
        #!/bin/sh
        cd /data/family-history/DhG-dir
        exec /data/family-history/tools/DhG/Dh_GBrowse.pl /data/family-history/database
      </pre>
       You can do other useful things in this script. This is one possible place to set the
       PERL5LIB environment variable. You can also select your editor; DhG uses the <tt>vi</tt>
       editor by default, which isn't to everyone's taste. You can select your editor the
       old-fashioned way by setting one of the environment variables <tt>VISUAL</tt> or
       <tt>EDITOR</tt>. DhG first looks as <tt>VISUAL</tt> then at <tt>EDITOR</tt>. So
      <pre>
        VISUAL=gedit
        export VISUAL
      </pre>
       in the script (before the 'exec' line) tells DhG to use gedit. IMPORTANT: Always use a text editor
       for this job. Never use a word processor. One thing to note: DhG always suspends itself while the
       editor is running. When the editor runs in the xterm this is what you'd expect, but with a GUI
       editor like gedit, you can minimise the editor window and then it looks like DhG has crashed.
       The hint here is the last line of output from DhG: if it says something like
      <pre>
        Editing /data/family-history/database/Bloggs/FredBloggs-99.card...
      </pre>
       then the editor is still running, so find it, save the file and close the editor (or quit
       without saving - whatever is appropriate).</p>
    <p>Finally, copy the DhG script to somewhere in your $PATH (~/bin is usually a good place).</p>

    <h2>Invocation</h2>
    <p>Make your xterm big enough. I use 120x75 characters. Type <tt>DhG</tt> at the prompt.
       You should see something like:
      <pre>
help                     = Print this text
list                     = List all people
family &lt;person&gt;          = Print family of a single person
descendants &lt;person&gt;     = Print all descendants of a single person
ancestors &lt;person&gt;       = Print all ancestors of a single person
search &lt;pattern&gt;         = Print name of people that match given terms
find &lt;pattern&gt;           = Print name of people that match given terms
quit                     = Close program
edit &lt;person&gt;            = Edit a person's card
vi                       = (alias for edit)
reload                   = Reload the database
set &lt;name&gt;=&lt;value&gt;       = Set a variable
htmlcard &lt;person&gt;        = Output a card file in HTML
htmlcard all             = Output a card file in HTML for every person in the database
htmlcard public          = Output a card file in HTML for every "public" person in the database
hc                       = (alias for htmlcard)
htmldesc &lt;person&gt;        = Output a public descendant tree in HTML
htmldesc @&lt;filename&gt;     = Output a public descendant tree in HTML for each person listed in the file
hd                       = (alias for htmldesc)
htmlprivdesc &lt;person&gt;    = Output a private descendant tree in HTML
htmlprivdesc @&lt;filename&gt; = Output a private descendant tree in HTML for each person listed in the file
hpd                      = (alias for htmlprivdesc)
htmlanc                  = Output an ancestor tree (Ahnentafel) in HTML
ha                       = (alias for htmlanc)
