   <h1>DhG User's Guide</h1>
   <div id="QuickStart">
    <h2>Quick start</h2>
    <p>Run the program, use the <i>new</i> command to create files for all the people in your family tree,
      use the <i>reload</i> command to make sure the information has been loaded, then create
      family trees using the <i>ancestor</i> and <i>descendant</i> commands. Easy peasy :-) </p>
    <p>But seriously ...</p>
   </div>

   <div id="PrincipleOfOperation">
    <h2>Principle of operation</h2>
    <p><strong>DhG</strong> uses structured text files to store information about individuals in your family tree.
      These files are called "cards" and have the suffix ".card" - a bit like electronic versions
      of cards in a card index. Each card contains information about a single person.
      The information that is stored can be as little or as much as you like,
      but for the family analysis to work each person's father and mother are needed wherever possible.
      Other information such as birth, baptism, marriage, death, burial and census records can be
      stored. Parent to child relationships are not stored in the parents' cards but are inferred from the
      children's cards.</p>
    <p><strong>DhG</strong> does not store this information itself; rather, it directs you to create the cards using
      a normal text editor. Apart from the step of initially creating a person's card, <strong>DhG</strong> does not
      modify any of the cards. It simply uses the information in the cards to construct relationships
      and produce various reports in plain text and HTML format. This method of operation means that
      you can safely close <strong>DhG</strong> at any time without losing any data. It also means that several
      instances of <strong>DhG</strong> can be running on the same database at the same time, but if you do this
      you need to take care when editing cards and especially when creating new ones; there is a danger
      that the same unique number will be allocated to two different people.</p>
   </div>

   <div id="CommandDrivenOperation">
    <h2>Command-driven operation</h2>
    <p><strong>DhG</strong>, or more precisely its browser program <strong>Dh_GBrowse</strong>, runs in a terminal
      window and uses a command interface. At the "What now?" prompt you type in a command and <tt>Dh_GBrowse</tt>
      does what the command tells it to do.</p>
    <p><tt>Dh_GBrowse</tt> uses the <tt>readline</tt> library to accept commands. This means that
      you can recall commands from the list you have already typed using the up-arrow and down-arrow
      keys. You can edit commands by using the left-arrow and right-arrow keys to move the cursor,
      insert new characters by typing them and delete characters by using DEL or BACKSPACE.
      Filename completion is available by pressing TAB, but this is of limited use because
      <tt>Dh_GBrowse</tt>'s use of files and directories is mostly hidden.</p>
    <p>The commands you type can be abbreviated to the first few characters, but you must type
      enough characters for the command to be unambiguous.</p>
   </div>

   <div id="StructureOfACard">
    <h2>Structure of a card</h2>
    <p>The following example illustrates how a card should be written. The exact layout is not
      very important - the number of spaces, for example, can be chosen to make the cards easy to
      read. What is important is the line structure and the grouping of lines. The order of events
      in the card is used when an HTML card for the person is produced, otherwise it plays no role
      in the analysis.</p>

    </tt></pre>
    <p>This is a fairly simple card file,  but contains all the necessary elements for <strong>DhG</strong> to
      analyse Fred's relationships and place him into the family tree. Let's look at the individual
      lines in this file one at a time...
    <pre><tt>
      Name:       Fred Bloggs</tt></pre>
      This is the person's name. Everybody has one, so it has to be present. In some cases you might
      only know part of the name. For example, the mother's maiden name might not be known, or the
      forename of a child might not be known if you're gathering information from relatives. In these
      cases it's useful to use a placeholder such as "unknown". I frequently use "_". It may also be useful
      to create a card file for someone for whom no name is known. This happens in older baptism records
      when only the father's name was given - but you know that a mother must have existed.
    <pre><tt>
      Uniq:       222</tt></pre>
      This is the unique identifier that is assigned to the person. Every person must have an identifier,
      and the identifier must be a positive number. Don't use 0. <tt>Dh_GBrowse</tt> automatically assigns
      a unique identifier when you use the "new" command.
    <pre><tt>
      Male</tt></pre>
      The person's gender. "Female" is also valid. <tt>Dh_GBrowse</tt> doesn't use this for any practical
      purpose at the moment, although it might be of use for future features. When <tt>Dh_GBrowse</tt>
      starts (or when the "reload" command is used), it notes the relationship between first name
      and gender, so that (given a large enough database) the gender of a new person can be guessed.
      A message like "Rennie could be a M or F name" at startup simply means that there are several
      people called Rennie in the database; some male and some female.
    <pre><tt>
      Father:     Joe Bloggs [123]</tt></pre>
      This indicates who Fred's father was. The name makes the card file nicely readable and the
      unique identifier (in brackets) guarantees that <tt>Dh_GBrowse</tt> finds the correct
      person when analysing the relationships.
    <pre><tt>
      Mother:     Ada McTiggle [136]</tt></pre>
      This indicates who Fred's mother was. McTiggle was her maiden name.
    <pre><tt>
      Version:    2</tt></pre>
      This indicates that the card uses version 2 of the card layout specification. If this
      line is omitted, nothing bad will happen because <strong>DhG</strong> only supports version 2 now. However,
      it's a good idea to leave it in place in case the structure changes again.
    <pre><tt>
      1827-04-22  Birth</tt></pre>
      This line is the start of a "Birth" event. It gives the date of birth. <strong>DhG</strong> uses
      the date in the reports.
      <strong>DhG</strong> treats any line that starts with a numeric digit or '?' as the start of an event; the
      first field (up to the first space) is the date of the event. The complete set of
      <a href="#DateFormat">date formats</a> is described later.
      For all types of event, the following lines of text provide extra information about the event.
      The lines starting with a '+' symbol are primary information. Lines starting with a '-' symbol
      are secondary information - these are usually file names, URLs etc. relating to +Source lines.
      Lines starting with '|' are continuation lines and are usually used with a -Transcript line.
      following lines that start with '+', '-' or '|' provide extra information about this event.
    <pre><tt>
      +Source     Baptism record</tt></pre>
      This line indicates the source of the information about the date of birth. In this case,
      the date comes from the baptism record, which is recorded below the birth record.
    <pre><tt>
      1827-05-01  Baptism</tt></pre>
      The start of another event; in this case, Fred's baptism.
    <pre><tt>
      +Place      St Never, Much Binding in the Marsh</tt></pre>
      A primary information line providing more information about the event. In this case, where
      the event took place.
    <pre><tt>
      +Source     Baptism certificate</tt></pre>
      The source of information is Fred's baptism certificate.
    <pre><tt>
      -File       Image       BAP-1827-FredBloggs.png</tt></pre>
      A secondary information line; in this case indicating that the source (the baptism certificate)
       can be found in a file called <tt>BAP-1827-FredBloggs.png</tt>.
       I don't put the full path name to files into the cards; it gives me the freedom to rearrange
       my computer without having to edit all my cards.
       Searching for files is a routine job for computers, and to speed things up there are various
       indexing programs available.
    <pre><tt>
      +Source     Genealogic</tt></pre>
      Another source; in this case a fictitious website called Genealogic that purportedly provides
      parish records.
    <pre><tt>
      -URL        http://genealogic.org/parishes/StNeverMuchBinding.html#1283</tt></pre>
      Another example of a secondary information line. In this case, it's the URL of the transcript. Be wary of
       pay-to-view sites here; if you use the HTML features of <strong>DhG</strong> to create a website, your
       visitors might not be able to see the record. Even worse - they might get charged unexpectedly!

      -Transcript
      | 1827 1st May  -  Fred son of Joe and Ada Bloggs  -  Born 22nd April  -   Rev. Tarquin Featherstonehaugh</tt></pre>
      Another secondary information line about the Genealogic source. It's a transcript of the record. Note
      the continuation line starting with '|'.
    <pre><tt>
      1853-04-23  Marriage    Ethel Gumby [247]</tt></pre>
      Another event, in this case Fred's marriage. Note that the spouse is named on the same line.

      Fred's burial in the churchyard. </p>
    <p></p>
    <p>As you can see, the card structure is quite straightforward. For most of its functions, <strong>DhG</strong>
      only uses the name, the unique number, the father and mother and the birth, marriage and death events.
      The other information is used when creating HTML versions of the index cards for use on a
      website.</p>
    <p>The event types and the keywords for primary and secondary information lines are flexible; you can
      add your own custom types if you like. <strong>DhG</strong> only uses the first word of the event type
      and the rest of the line is ignored. There are two exceptions to this behaviour; the Marriage event
      identifies the spouse, and there is an event type called "Misc", where the rest of the line is used as
      a description of the event.</p>
    <p>The standard event types and information keywords are shown in the <a href="#Keywords">keywords</a>
      section.</p>

   <p>A <strong>person</strong> is specified either by name or by unique identifier. If a name is given
     <strong>DhG</strong> uses a search algorithm rather than an exact match, so you can just type
     in some parts of the name, such as "Fre Bl" if you want Fred Bloggs. If there's more than one
     match, <strong>DhG</strong> prints a list of matches instead of performing the command. You can
     then repeat the command using a better match; alternatively (and more likely) you can use the
     unique identifier.</p>
   <p>The <strong>pattern</strong> for the <i>search</i> and <i>find</i> commands works just like
     the name variant for specifying a person.</p>
   <p>A "private" person is one who is still alive (i.e. for whom no death is recorded), or who has
     been explicitly marked as private using "Private" on a line by itself in the card (usually
     in the header near the name. In any given family, a whole generation will be treated as
     private if any one of them or their spouses, siblings, siblings of spouses, spouses of siblings etc.
     is alive of marked as private.</p>
   <p>The <i>set</i> command is used to set internal variables. The variables that are recognised
     are <strong>DBG</strong>, <strong>FORMAT</strong>, <strong>DATE</strong> and <strong>CARDBASE</strong>.
    <dl>
      <di>
        <dt><strong>DBG</strong></dt>
        <dd>The "debug" level (a number from 0 upwards), which controls how much diagnostic

        <dt><strong>FORMAT</strong></dt>
        <dd>No longer used.</dd>

        <dt><strong>DATE</strong></dt>
        <dd>Controls the format of the date when printing or generating HTML output. Possible
          values are <strong>raw</strong>, <strong>yearonly</strong>, <strong>noquarter</strong>.</dd>
      </di>
      <di>
        <dt><strong>CARDBASE</strong></dt>
        <dd>Specifies the directory where new card files will be created. New files will be created
          in a subdirectory of this directory by the surname. E.g. Fred Bloggs' card file would
          be called $CARDBASE/Bloggs/FredBloggs-222.card. By using CARDBASE, you can separate the
          major branches of your tree into different directories.</dd>

     <h3>Primary information keywords</h3>
     <p>After an event, lines starting with a '+' character are treated as primary information
       for the event, such as place, age etc. The lines are intended to contain information
       that is extracted from records of the event and is only as accurate as those records.</p>
     <p>Most of these keywords are not interpreted in any special way by DhG, so these are just
       examples.</p>

         <dt>Source</dt><dd>A source for the information about the event. Source lines
          are used by DhG when constructing HTML cards and are placed in a specal column.
          If a secondary URL line is present (see below), the source name is converted to a link.</dd>
       </di>
      </dl>
    </div>
    <div>
     <h3>Secondary information keywords</h3>
     <p>After a primary information keyword there can be secondary information keywords. At the
       moment, these only apply to the Source lines, and are used to indicate where
       the source material can be found. As usual, they are flexible. Very few are actually
       interpreted by DhG.</p>
     <dl>
       <di>
         <dt>File</dt><dd>A file on the local PC containing an image or transcript of
           the record. The file name is preceded by the type (Transcript, Image, Photo
           etc.) and is specified without directory path.</dd>

       <di>
         <dt>URL</dt><dd>A URL for the record. When generating an HTML card, DhG uses this
           URL to convert the source text into a link.</dd>
       </di>
       <di>
         <dt>Transcript</dt><dd>A transcript of the source record. The transcript can go over several lines
          using the continutaion character '|'. I recommend putting the entire transcript on
          continuation lines for readability.</dd>

   <div id="Annoyances">
    <h2>Annoying "features"</h2>
    <p>After creating or editing a card, the new information isn't in the database until you <i>reload</i>.</p>
    <p>The <strong>CARDBASE</strong> variable has no default value; you are forced to set it before
      you can create a new card.</p>
    <p><strong>DhG</strong> tries to be as flexible as possible when reading the card files, so incorrect
      keywords are often ignored with no error messages.
