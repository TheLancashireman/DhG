Database structure:
===================

In a given base directory for a family...
Directory : Surname
File: ForenamesSurname-id.card

The id is a number from 1 upwards that is unique throughout the database.

Examples:
---------

Haworth/DavidHaworth-42.card
Edmondson/JamesWilliamEdmondson-123.card

DhG doesn't actually care how the files are names or organised, but the "new" command creates
files according to this scheme, so it's useful to stick with it.

Contents of each file:

Header:
=======
Name: Forenames Surname
Uniq: <positive number that is unique for this person throughout the database>
Male|Female
Private|Public (optional)
Father: Forenames Surname [Uniq] (optional)
Mother: Forenames Surname [Uniq] (optional)
Note: some text
| continuation line

Use _ for unknown names.

EOF  (on a line on its own) indicates the end of parseable data. Lines after this
     are not parsed and can be used for unformatted research notes.

Date format
-----------
YYYY-MM-DD    Exact date
YYYY-MM       Month known but not day
YYYY          Year known but not month or day
YYYY-MM-DD~   Approximate date
YYYY-MM~      Year known, month approximate.
YYYY~         Approximate year known
YYYY-Qq       Quarter known. Q=letter, q=1,2,3,4
?             Date not known

The "Quarter" date format is used when the registration of the birth/marriage or death is the only
information known. The actual date could be much earlier in some cases.


Commands
========

help                     = Print this text
list                     = List all people
family <person>          = Print family of a single person
descendants <person>     = Print all descendants of a single person
ancestors <person>       = Print all ancestors of a single person
search <pattern>         = Print name of people that match given terms
find <pattern>           = Print name of people that match given terms
quit                     = Close program
new <name>               = Create a new person in a subdirectory of the CARDBASE directory
edit <person>            = Edit a person's card
vi                       = (alias for edit)
reload                   = Reload the database
set <variable>=<value>   = Set a variable
htmlcard <person>        = Output a card file in HTML
htmlcard all             = Output a card file in HTML for every person in the database
htmlcard public          = Output a card file in HTML for every "public" person in the database
hc                       = (alias for htmlcard)
htmldesc <person>        = Output a public descendant tree in HTML
htmldesc @<filename>     = Output a public descendant tree in HTML for each person listed in the file
hd                       = (alias for htmldesc)
htmlprivdesc <person>    = Output a private descendant tree in HTML
htmlprivdesc @<filename> = Output a private descendant tree in HTML for each person listed in the file
hpd                      = (alias for htmlprivdesc)

<person> is either a name, a unique id, or a name and id. Parts of names can be given; for example,
"Fr Bl" matches with Fred Bloggs, but also matches with Freda Blepp. If the selection results
in more than one match a list is printed instead of performing the command. The command can then be repeated
using the unique ID of the desired person from the list.

<name> (in the 'new' command) is assumed to be of the form Forenames Surname. The unique ID is automatically
generated. The gender is implied from the gender of other people with the same name. If not defined, it
is left blank. After the card file is created, an editor is opened to fill in details.

A person is "public" if the entire generation connected by sibling and marriage/partnership relationships to
that person is also "public". A single living person in the generation will cause the entire
generation to be "private". A single individual that is explicitly made "private" will also cause
the entire generation to be private.
